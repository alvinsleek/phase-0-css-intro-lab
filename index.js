let companyName = 'Scuber';

const companyName = 'Scuber';

const currentUser = 'Grace Hopper';

const welcomeMessage = 'currentuser';

const welcomeMessage = 'Welcome to Flatbook, currentUser';


const myString = 'template literal';

const myNumber = 10;

const myBoolean = false;

`Saying that interpolation with ${myString}s is better than concatenation ${90 + myNumber}% of the time is simply ${myBoolean}. But it is pretty cool!

Beware that new lines inside of a ${myString} will be preserved as new lines in the resulting ${typeof myString}!`;
